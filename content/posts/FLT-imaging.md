# Introduction

- Retention of 18F FDG in the tumor reflects cellular growth and proliferation only in the past.
- Moreover, 18F FDG uptake has also been associated with false positive findings resulting from unspecific tracer uptake in inflammatory process. 
- Many drugs have been designed to inhibit cell proliferation and/or to induce apoptosis.
- Therefore in-vivo assessment of proliferation seems a promising tool for imaging cancer and assessing response to treatment. 


- Proloiferation imaging helps in 
1. Differentiation between benign and malignant.
2. Non invasive grading. 


# 18F FLT 

- 3'deoxy-3'-18F Fluorothymidine (FLT) is used for noninvasive assessment of proliferation and more specific tumor imaging. 
- It is a neucleoside analogue, derived from cytostatic drug Azidothymidine (AZT).
- There is upregulation of DNA synthesis pathway in tumors. 
- Thymidine kinase 1 is idenitifed as key enzyme responsible for intracellular trapping 18F FLT. There is upregulation of TK-1 expression in tumors. 
- It is taken up by the tumor cells by passive diffusion and facilitated transport (ENT-1)
- Imaging of DNA proliferation is superior to imaging glucose metabolism for assessing response to treatment because cells may maintain their oxidative and glycolytic function on spite of impaired DNA synthesis.


# Applications:

## Head and Neck:

- FLT does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier, the physiological brain uptake is low, especially in comparison with 18F FDG.
- Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, however, can cause significant 18F FLT retention without cell proliferation. 
- Used in detection and treatment monitoring og gliomas.
- It cannot differentiate between high grade and low grade tumors. 

- Physiological uptake in neck region is low. Therefore 18F FLT is believed to discriminate between inflammatory and neoplastic lymph node involvement. But false positives is seen in some lymph nodes. 

- Further physiologic uptake is noted in proliferating bone marrow present in the cervical spine and to a lesser extent the skull. Therefore, there is decreased sensitivity in bone marrow infiltration and primary and secondary bone lesions. 
- However, in patients with NHL, even osseous lesions were detected because focal FLT uptake was greater than in surrounding bone marrow. 
- High physiologic uptake in proliferating bone marrow is successfully used to visualise the viable bone marrow compartment in patients with aplastic anemia and to identify organs with ongoing extraosseous hematopoiesis.

## Thorax:

- Physiologic lung parenchyma shows only ver low 18F FLT uptake, and therefore permits the proposal that any kind of increased pulmonary 18F FLT uptake is highly suspicious of a malignant tumor. 
- Increased FLT uptake in heart is because of accumulation of the tracer in the blood pool and muscle tissue of LV, obscuring breast and lung lesion. 
- However, blood pool activity is washed out by 45 minutes. 
- Physiologic uptake is also noted in the rib cae and dorsal vertebrae due to proliferating bone marrow. 

## Abdomen:

- Increased physiologic uptake is noted in liver, intestines, ribs, dorsal and lumbar vertebrae.
- 18F FLT undergoes extensive glucoronidation in the human liver, resulting in approximately 25% of plasma activity being present as 18F FLT glucoronide at 60 minutes after injection. 
- Even if high uptake is noted in the liver, suspected HCC lesion shows higher uptake than surrounding liver activity. 
- Attempts to reduce the liver uptake using probenecid were done, but failed. 

- Physiologic uptake in GI mucosa is due to mucosa cells undergoing rapid proliferation. 

## Pelvis:

- FLT is excreted by kidneys in its non metabolised form and also in 18F FLT glucoronide form.
- At 60 minutes post injection, 18F FLT is seen in kidneys and genitourinary system. 
- No physiologic uptake is noted in uterus, ovaries, prostate and seminal vesicles. 

## Treatment induced effects:
 
- In response to chemotherapy, reduced FLT uptake is expected. 
- But sometimes, increased FLT uptake is noted, due to flare phenomenon.
