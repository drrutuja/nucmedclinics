- Paget disease is often included in the metabolic bone disease category, although mechanisms causing this disorder are not entirely understood, with genetic and environmental causes proposed. 
- A chronic disease of the elderly.


## Clinical Features:
Patients may experience 
- pain, 
- arthritis, and 
- neurological symptoms related to changes in the bone. 
- Congestive heart failure can occur
- rarely (1%) patients develop osteosarcomas.


## Phases:

The disease has three phases: 
- the early resorptive, 
- mixed middle, and 
- final sclerotic phases. 


## Investigations:


- The diagnosis usually can be made by radiographs, which reveal lytic lesions in early cases and coarsened, expanded bones as the disease progresses to the final phase. 
- Although CT and MR can be used to assess complications, bone scan is highly sensitive and useful to evaluate the extent of disease. 


## Bone scan:


- Increased uptake is seen in all stages of untreated disease, although sensitivity is lower in the early lytic stage. 
- Activity decreases with effective therapy. 
- In addition, the patterns of Paget disease must be recognized because it may be found incidentally because many patients are asymptomatic and undiagnosed.
- Bone often appears expanded. 
- When the tibia is involved, bowing is often seen, and in the spine, fractures can happen. 
- The pelvis is the most commonly involved site, followed by the spine, skull, femur, scapula, tibia, and humerus.
