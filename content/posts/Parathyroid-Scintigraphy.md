- The parathyroid glands are able to concentrate a variety of chemical substances.
- Tc99m sestamibi is the most commonly used agent. 
- Works on differential washout of MIBI from thyroid and parathyroid gland. 
- Single isotope- double phase technique 
- MIBI washes out early from the thyroid gland compared to parathyroid gland. 
- Retention is proportional to number of oxyphil cells.
- Physiological uptake noted in thyroid gland, heart, liver, salivary gland.

## Protocol


- Single injection of 20-30mCi of Tc99m Sestamibi given I.V.
- Planer image is taken at 15 minutes (early) and 1.5 to 3 hours later (late)
- Followed by SPECT or SPECT/CT for each time. 
- Thyroid scan with Tc99m pertechnetate is done 
- Chest/whole body survey is done to look for ectopic lesion/ brown tumour. 
- Subtraction images are taken and compared
- A persistent focus of activity, in delayed images, relative to the thyroid gland activity, indicative of the parathyroid lesion.

## Advantages:


- Relatively operator independent in comparison with USG 
- Detects ectopic and posterior glands that USG may miss
- Provide valuable anatomic landmark
- Lower radiation dose than with 4D CT
- Can we used as a tool in operating room for parathyroid localization- Radio guided parathyroidectomy. 


## Limitations:


- Patients must remain relatively motionless for a longer period of time 
- More expensive than USG and 4D-CT scans 
- Scintigraphy perform poorly at detecting small glands (<300mg), multi-gland disease (<50% sensitivity) 
- Subtypes with fewer oxyphil cells do not take up tracer
- Sometimes parathyroid carcinoma, thyroid nodules, thyroid malignancy lymph adenopathy can also mimic these findings.
