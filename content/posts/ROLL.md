# Introduction

- The radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) technique has been used in breast conservative surgery by associating lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. 
- The combination of two techniques is commonly known as SNOLL - Sentinel lymph node and occult lesion localization.

## Radioguided localization of occult breast lesion

- Extensive use of mammography has increased the identification of DCIS and LCIS. 
- Such lesions must be well located preoperatively, completely removed avoiding unnecessary traumas in the surrounding tissues and carefully centered in the specimen excised. 

## Procedure:

- For the localization of opacities and microcalcification observed by mammography device equipped with a computerised stereotactice system is used for guiding the injection once teh 3D coordinates of the lesion have been calculated. 

- Craniocaudal projections are acquiredd for lesions located in the superior and inferior breast quadrants, and external and internal lateral projections are obtained for lesions in the lateral and medial quadrants.

- A 22 guage needle in the stereotactic frame is inserted in the lesion with position of the needle tip corresponding to the calculated coordinates.

- New mammogram is obtained to verify the location of the tip of the needle. 

- Injection of the 99mTc MAA is given followed by immediate administration of 0.2ml of radioopaque contrast medium.

- Remove Needle. 

- Take another image to verify that the contrast medium has been properly located in the lesion. 

### Using Ultrasound Guidance:

- When the occult lesion is displated by ultrasound, the radiotracer is injected under ultrasonographic guidance.

- Examination id done using a liner probe at a frequency of 10 to 13 or 7.5 to 10MHz, depending on breast size. 

- Then another probe (7.5 to 10MHz) is cinnected to a needle biopsy device.

- The needle is introduced in the device and manually inserted in the center of the breast lesion. 

- The radiotracer is then injected followed by 0.2ml of saline. 

### Post Injection Procedure
- Later, Scintigraphic images are acquired for 5 to 10 minutes with 512 x 512 matrix and zoom of 1.3 in order to exclude external radioactive contamination. 
- If the area of administration of the radiotracer is a clear cut spot, patient can undergo excisional biopsy. 
- When the radiotracer has diffused over a large area of breast, localization should be replicated by an alternative method. 


### Surgery:

- Surgery can be performed on the same or on the following day.
- The gamma probe is introduced by a small skin incision. 
- Intraoperative localization of the injection site of 99mTc MAA by gamma probe permits early identification and removal of the breast lesion.
- The specimen is counted ex-vivo by the gamma probe to confirm complete removal of the lesion. It could also be radiographed to verify the success of the procedure.
